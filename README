The .m file code will compute orientation as well as irregularity measure and plot
them on the same figure under title "Orientation Map" and "Irregularity Map Image"
respectively. For getting these two images for each of the 10 fingerprints all you
need to do is provide the path of each input image correctly in the imread argument
at line 11 of the code.

Algorithm for computing orientations

1. Gradients Gx and Gy are computed at each piexel
2. Gxx, Gyy, Gxy are computed according to the following
   formula:- Gxx= square of Gx,
   			 Gyy= square of Gy,
   			 Gxy= Gx*Gy
3. The orientations are calculated by using the following formula
 
   theta = pi/2 + (1/2)arctan(2*Gxy/(Gxx-Gyy))

I am providing a spacing of 15 units between orientation line segments
